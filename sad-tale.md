House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.
Ned went on to open up a book shop & eatery on a lakefront in Wales, lived a long life and is survived by two doting children and their pet dog, Miles.
Live your wildest dreams Ned!
